      At Beach Ballerinas we use the Oz Tots program created by Marcia Lindoorn
      in Randwick


      [OZ TOTS](http://www.oztots.com/oz-tots) is Sydney's longest running dance, music & movement school for toddlers up to 8 year olds! We give your TOT the best possible start with an established and proven program. Our classes involve so much more than dance & music and many parents are often surprised at the unexpected benefits the programs give their children.
