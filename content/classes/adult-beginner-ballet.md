description: >-
  For all the adults who want to learn the basics of ballet in a casual manner.
  A fun class, learning basic technique from the foundations of ballet with a
  combination of a barre workout.


  Classical ballet is characterised by a standard vocabulary of steps, poses, and graceful movements - including pointed feet, rising, jumping, stretching and spinning. It is strengthening, disciplined and stylised.

  The class starts with exercises at the barre followed by work in the centre.


  There is no such thing as being 'too old' - with fitness and technique one can do miracles!
