   Each class is a gorgeous and fun way for little dancers to explore dance with the right balance between structure and creativity. Dancers will learn proper ballet steps and positions developing a quality foundation to move up to the Pre-Primary Royal Academy of Dance level.

  * Fun activities include basic dance steps

  * Patterning, directional and spatial awareness

  *  Having fun with friends through partner and group exercises

  * A little more structured and challenging than the 3 year olds which helps in their preparation for their future school days

  * Working towards our FUN open day for parents at the end of each Term
