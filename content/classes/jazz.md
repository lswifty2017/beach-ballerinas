description: >-
  Beach Ballerinas jazz class dancers learn funky age appropriate routines with
  a technical focus. Jazz is a great free movement class for dancers after a
  ballet class and builds dancer presence, awareness and confidence. 


  A very fun, higher energy and moving class for kindergarten kids. Students will also learn a progression from the 3 & 4 year olds program, and also start to technically dance. Strength and stretching exercises are formally introduced in this level which assists with childrens posture and dance technique.
