order: "4"
title: Jazz
subtitle: Bondi Beach
description: >-
  Beach Ballerinas jazz class dancers learn funky age appropriate routines with
  a technical focus. Jazz is a great free movement class for dancers after a
  ballet class and builds dancer presence, awareness and confidence. 


  This class is available for Kindergarten and up and is also offered in combination with Ballet (30 mins Ballet and 30 mins Jazz).


  The progression will accelerate with this age group, as they are a little older and more aware of their bodies. Strength and stretching exercises are formally introduced in this level, which assists with posture and dance technique.
