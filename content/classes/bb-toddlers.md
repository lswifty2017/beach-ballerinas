  Beach Ballerinas hold classes for 3-5 year olds that are a beautiful introduction
  to the wonderful world of dance. We use the Oz Tots Program that has been
  established for over three decades and proven to be most affective for
  toddlers and dance! 

  * Introducing creative and educational group tasks for literacy and numeracy

  * Enjoy passive stretching, learning body parts, introducing rhythm through clapping, beating and playing musical instruments to music

  * Develop gross motor skills such as skipping, galloping, jumping with props

  * Sing to fun age appropriate songs

  * Working towards our FUN open day for parents at the end of each Term
