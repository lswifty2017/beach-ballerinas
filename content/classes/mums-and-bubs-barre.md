  Mums and Dads want to dance too! Perfect class if you have a little one not
  quite ready to dance yet solo. This  class, is a magical time of bonding that
  you can share with your little one creating everlasting memories.


  You and your little one can learn dancing together, trying out new moves and testing your performance skills. Listen to the music and let little one express what they feel.


  You don’t need to have any previous ballet or dance skills – you just need to be ready to have a fabulous time with your dancer. Be ready to dance, move, sing, play and have plenty of fun – just like your little person!
