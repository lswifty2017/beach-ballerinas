description: >-
  Beach Ballerinas Combo is perfect class for Kindy kids- The best of both dance
  worlds 30 mins Ballet and 30 mins Jazz! 


  Pre-Primary classical ballet programme introduces the Royal Academy of Dance syllabus and continues the development of ballet technique as new steps are introduced to challenge our young dancers.


  Our Jazz Program is a development from our 4 year olds class where dancers learn funky age appropriate routines with a technical focus. Jazz is a great free movement class for dancers after a ballet class and builds dancer presence, awareness and confidence.


  A very fun, higher energy and moving class for kindergarten kids. Strength and stretching exercises are formally introduced in this level which assists with childrens posture and dance technique.
