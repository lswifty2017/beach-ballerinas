  Beach Ballerinas hold classes for 3 year olds that is a beautiful introduction
  to the wonderful world of dance. We use the Oz tots Program that has been
  established for over three decades and proven to be most affective for
  toddlers and dance! 


  * Introducing creative and educational group tasks for literacy and numeracy

  * Enjoy passive stretching, learning body parts, introducing rhythm through clapping and beating to music and using musical instruments 

  * Develop gross motor skills i.e. skipping, galloping, jumping and using props

  * Sing to fun songs especially written for this age group

  * So much fun in a loving and nurturing environment 

  * Working towards our FUN open day for parents at the end of each Term
